      "text": "Wuffs is a programming language designed specifically for safely handling file formats, like images, audio, video, and compressed archives. It's fast! Wuffs can decode bzip2 faster than bzcat, deflate faster than zlib, GIF faster than giflib, image/gif, and gif, and PNG faster than libpng, image/png, and png!\n\nWhile Wuffs is a language, it's not for writing entire programs. Instead, it's designed to be used within larger projects, allowing developers to write performance-critical and security-sensitive code in a safe and efficient way. The Wuffs compiler checks for common errors like buffer overflows, integer overflows, and null pointer dereferences at compile time, ensuring that if the code compiles, it's safe!\n\nWuffs is a powerful tool that offers a balance of speed and safety, making it an ideal choice for anyone who needs to work with file formats securely and efficiently. It's still under development, but its GIF decoder has already been shipped in the Google Chrome web browser.",
