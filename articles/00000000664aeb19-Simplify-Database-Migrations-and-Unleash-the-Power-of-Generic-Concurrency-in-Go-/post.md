## [Unlock the Power of Generic Concurrency in Go!](https://sergey.kamardin.org/articles/generic-concurrency-in-go)

This article explores the exciting potential of generics in Go, particularly in the context of concurrency patterns. The author delves into the world of concurrent mapping, where collections of elements are transformed into new collections by applying a function to each individual element.

The article begins by showcasing the benefits of generics over the pre-generics era. It then takes a deep dive into implementing a concurrent mapping function called "transform" in various stages, starting with a naive implementation and gradually incorporating features like context cancellation and concurrency limits.  The author highlights the subtle nuances of managing errors and flow control in a concurrent environment.

Finally, the article introduces a more general-purpose function called "iterate," which allows for flexible concurrent iteration over various data structures. The author demonstrates how this function can be used to reimplement "transform" and even mimic the functionality of the popular "errgroup" package. The article concludes by looking toward the future with Go iterators, emphasizing the potential for even more elegant and powerful concurrent programming paradigms.
